Cheerio library is used for this project. (link = "https://cheerio.js.org/")

Challenges:
	I can say that I had difficulty in understanding the system at first, since it is an area that I do not know at all. 
	In addition, I had difficulties in finding the desired scales. It took me a while to parsing text from inside div classes.
	Finally, sorting the table by availability is not working properly when the sheet mailed to someone.
	
I learned web scraping with Google App Script using Cheerio library, how we fetch the urls and analyze them, and how to easily get the data we want.
And we can automate this process to run specific times.

Answers of additional questions are in the .pptx file.
